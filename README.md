# IOC_Internship
During my internship, I gained hands-on experience with cloud computing concepts and technologies, including:

Cloud computing basics, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)
Cloud deployment and management

This internship has given me a strong foundation in cloud computing and has prepared me for a career in this rapidly growing field. I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to help businesses and organizations adopt cloud computing to achieve their goals.
